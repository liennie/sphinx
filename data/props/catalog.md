# Kabuto Sumo

Beetles step into the sumo ring, ready to clash. Each player takes turns sliding pieces onto the board. Every push threatens to knock rivals closer to the edge. Tension builds as the platform grows crowded. Luck, dexterity, and planning all play a role. Edge control is everything—stay firm or fall.

Brilliant comebacks happen when a single move shifts the pile. Actions feel simple, but decisions carry weight. The ring is unforgiving, and mistakes are costly. Thrilling cascades of pieces can flip the match in an instant. Legends are written by the beetle who holds the ground. Every bout is fast, tense, and endlessly replayable. Step up, take your place, and battle for glory.
