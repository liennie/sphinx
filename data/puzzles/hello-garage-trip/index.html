				<h2>Prologue of Keys</h2>
				<p>Five verses stand before the seeker’s sight,<br>
					Each bearing gifts concealed in woven song.<br>
					The first proclaims the journey and the rite,<br>
					The last recalls the pattern all along.</p>
				<p>One hides a phrase, a word that must be known,<br>
					Another guards a number, sharp and true.<br>
					A third bestows the law through which they’re shown,<br>
					The shaping rule that binds the path anew.</p>
				<p>So let these five together weave the frame,<br>
					A prologue set, an epilogue foretold.<br>
					From word, from number, and from law the same,<br>
					The path is carved, the hidden gate unrolled.</p>

				<h2>The Chosen Arena</h2>
				<p>Among the gathered relics of contest and chance,<br>
					Where wooden soldiers march and cards decree their will,<br>
					A record lies of trials preserved in play,<br>
					A chronicle of battles set in boxes still.</p>
				<p>Within those pages waits a crowded ring,<br>
					Where armored beetles struggle for the crown.<br>
					The clash of shells resounds, a sacred thing,<br>
					Their contest hides the truth that must be found.</p>
				<p>The secret rests where stories first take breath,<br>
					Initial marks assemble what is true.<br>
					From scattered signs arises life from death,<br>
					A hidden phrase revealed to those who knew.</p>

				<h2>The Mark of Passing Time</h2>
				<p>The mage drifts slow where centuries entwine,<br>
					Her shadow stretches long across the spine,<br>
					Through battles fought and memories divine,<br>
					A quiet mark rests waiting to be found.</p>
				<p>Her comrades age while fleeting seasons fade,<br>
					Yet something small endures that time has made,<br>
					A hidden token placed in careful shade,<br>
					Its secret whispers softly from the ground.</p>
				<p>Seek not the stars that blaze across the skies,<br>
					Nor blazing comets burning in your eyes,<br>
					But where the story pauses, still it lies,<br>
					A number held within the story’s bound.</p>

				<h2>The Cipher’s Walk</h2>
				<p>A key in hand, a string in tow,<br>
					we walk the path the symbols show.<br>
					Each letter turned, a shifting trace,<br>
					its form transformed, but kept in place.</p>
				<p>The key unwinds with every round,<br>
					by twenty-six it’s wound and bound.<br>
					A quiet reminder, soft and sly,<br>
					tells how far each spin will fly.</p>
				<p>A careful spin — not left to chance —<br>
					respects each letter’s native dance.<br>
					No change to those beyond the line,<br>
					just letters bent by key and time.</p>
				<p>And when the trail at last is done,<br>
					the key lies faint, its power spun.<br>
					What’s left behind, a cryptic thread —<br>
					a string once locked, now softly read.</p>

				<h2>The Path Revealed</h2>
				<p>From scattered signs the hidden shape is drawn,<br>
					The law unites what seemed apart and gone.<br>
					A path emerges, carved from silent hands,<br>
					A secret doorway only this command demands.</p>
				<p>The path appears where mind and measures duel,<br>
					Its course defined by reason, careful rule,<br>
					Each puzzle hence will bend to this same guide,<br>
					The way ahead revealed for those who stride.</p>
